# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `src/` contains the app code; entry points are `src/main.tsx` and `src/index.css`.
- `src/routes/` holds TanStack Router file-based routes (e.g., `board.$boardId.tsx`).
- `src/components/` is split into UI primitives (`src/components/ui/`) and feature components (e.g., dashboard).
- `src/lib/` contains shared utilities and API helpers; `src/store/` holds Zustand state.
- `src/types/` defines shared TypeScript models.
- Static assets live in `src/assets/` and `public/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `npm run dev`: start the Vite dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build`: type-check with `tsc -b`, then produce a production build.
- `npm run lint`: run ESLint on the project.
- `npm run preview`: serve the production build locally.
- Bun is also supported (`bun run dev`, etc.) since `bun.lock` is present.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- TypeScript + React 19; prefer `.tsx` for components and `.ts` for utilities.
- Routes are lowercase files in `src/routes/` with TanStack param syntax (e.g., `board.$boardId.tsx`).
- Use the `@/` alias for imports from `src` (configured in `vite.config.ts`).
- Styling is Tailwind CSS 4 + shadcn/ui; prefer utility classes over custom CSS.
- ESLint is the enforced linter; run `npm run lint` before committing.

## Testing Guidelines
- No automated test runner is configured yet; there are no `*.test.*` files.
- If you add tests, keep them near the feature (e.g., `src/components/Foo.test.tsx`) and update scripts accordingly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Git history only contains an initial commit; no established message convention exists.
- Use concise, imperative summaries (e.g., "Add board toolbar") and keep commits focused.
- PRs should include a clear description, linked issue (if any), and UI screenshots for visual changes.
- Note test commands run and any backend assumptions (API at `http://localhost:3000`, WS at `ws://localhost:3000/ws/boards/{boardId}`).

## Generated Files & Routing
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is generated by TanStack Router and should remain committed.
